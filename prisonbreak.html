The half building is on fire and the guards are trying to take out the criminals under their supervision. However, one of the prisoners manages to sneak out of his room before that and tries to escape the prison. After the guard realises that one of the prisoners is missing, he goes after him,with the intention to catch him. Meanwhile the prisoner is running for his life, trying to escape from the prison before the fire or the guard reaches him.

                The idea generation consisted of brainstorming sessions where the two of us just said every idea that came into our mind regarding the given themes.
                After feeling content with an idea, we returned back to it and started prototyping to see how it would work in real life; depending on that we kept or discarded the idea.

                The project was quite a challenge because of language barrier, but we have tried every way possible to make ourselves understood, share our ideas and opinions and then in the end deliver a quite successful game.
